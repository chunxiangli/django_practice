# django_practice
This repository contains the source code that I wrote while learning Django.
In the example folder contains two projects: the first one "helloapp" is for normal database operations,
and the second one "djangorest" is used to implement one restAPI using Django's rest_framework.
In the app folder contains the first pilot projects to implement a calculation based restAPI which
could return the result of a + b.

To run this code, it is recommend to run it in python virtual environment.
The first time to launch virtual environment and install the required libraries:
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

To exit from virtual environment:
deactivate

Next time just need to:
source venv/bin/activate
