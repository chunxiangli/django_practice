# django_practice
This repository contains the source code that I wrote while learning Django.
In the example folder contains two projects: the first one "helloapp" is for normal database operations,
and the second one "djangorest" is used to implement one restAPI using Django's rest_framework.
In the app folder contains the first pilot projects to implement a calculation based restAPI which
could return the result of a + b.
